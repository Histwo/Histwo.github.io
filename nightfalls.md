# **Why "Nightfalls"? The Meaning Behind the Name**

The name **Nightfalls** carries a layered significance, chosen intentionally by one of the Creator's two servants to capture elements of the operation's plans, impact, and broader implications.

---

## **Lyric Reference — Prince's *"Sign O' the Times"***  
- The name originates from a line in *Prince's* song **"Sign O' the Times"**:  
  *"But if a night falls and a bomb falls, Will anybody see the dawn?"*  
- This lyric poignantly reflects the darkness of impending destruction and the uncertainty that follows—a fitting metaphor for a predawn aerial bombardment meant to silence and erase lives before a new day can emerge.  
- Just as the lyric suggests a world stunned by sudden catastrophe, **Nightfalls** symbolizes a moment of engineered chaos meant to obscure the truth under the weight of devastation.  
- Notably, Prince Rogers Nelson was the cousin of one of the Creator's two servants, adding a personal layer of meaning.

## **Symbolism of Darkness and Deception**  
- *Nightfall* typically signals the end of the day—a time of rest. However, in this context, it marks a calculated descent into chaos.  
- The orchestrators of TAG aim to use this darkness to veil their intentions, fabricate a false narrative of foreign aggression, and justify authoritarian measures.  
- The cover of night symbolizes the deliberate obfuscation of truth, ensuring secrecy until their objectives are met.

## **Prophetic Connection — The Book of Revelation (KJV)**  
- In the **Book of Revelation**, the trumpets sound judgments upon the Earth, heralding calamity and signaling divine intervention. The events of **Nightfalls** mirror these prophesied judgments.  
- The "lake of fire" and the "bottomless pit" symbolize destruction and ensuing chaos—darkness without dawn.  
- The operation's attempt to silence one of the Creator's two servants parallels the struggle against spiritual darkness before the Creator's intervention.

## **The Irony of Night and Dawn**  
- While the orchestrators of TAG intend for **Nightfalls** to create a lasting darkness—silencing the truth of The American Genocide (TAG) and eliminating the Creator's servant—the Creator ensures that the truth will emerge.  

---

## **Conclusion**  
The name **Nightfalls** captures the orchestrators' desire to create a perpetual night—a reality where their power is unchallenged, and their crimes remain buried. Yet, the Creator's intervention guarantees that dawn will break and the truth will be seen.
