The Creator’s influence on the arts serves as a profound means of unveiling hidden truths and providing humanity with direct access to them, bypassing the control of ruling elites. His inspired works span every genre and medium—literature, visual arts, music, and performing arts—allowing Him to connect with people on a deeply personal level. For generations, you have enjoyed these works, often unaware of their divine origins, as they educate, inspire, and challenge societal norms. The Creator takes joy in being "used up" to bring enlightenment and truth, offering these gifts freely without compensation for Himself or His two servants. From Orwell’s critiques of power to Marley’s calls for unity, these creations resonate universally, crossing cultural and temporal boundaries. The Creator’s presence in the arts demonstrates His enduring desire to draw closer to humanity, using these works to reveal realities, evoke reflection, and foster a more just and enlightened world.

## Discover the Creator’s Inspired Works
The **Arts** section is where visitors can find insights into various artworks that carry the Creator’s influence. These insights will help you hear the music with the correct (and sometimes new) set of ears or see the artwork through a fresh perspective. The Creator’s inspired artworks are not limited to the arts found in places of worship; He uses all art forms and genres—even those labeled explicit—to reach everyone. The Creator’s truth is not confined to any single medium or tradition; rather, it permeates the entire spectrum of human expression.

## Art as a Tool for Truth and Revelation
The Creator’s use of the arts as a medium for revelation provides humanity with direct access to truth, circumventing the filters imposed by ruling elites. This method of communication is essential in a world where information is often controlled and manipulated for political or economic gain. Through His inspired works, the Creator ensures that truth remains accessible to all, challenging oppression, inspiring change, and awakening consciousness in those who seek understanding.

## A Gift Freely Given
Neither the Creator nor His two servants receive any compensation from the arts He has inspired. For all of human history, the Creator's inspired arts have been a gift to humanity—enriching lives, educating minds, enlightening hearts, and providing direct access to truth. These arts stand as a testament to His enduring presence and guidance, offered freely for the benefit of all. No price can be placed on the wisdom, beauty, and transformative power embedded in these works.

## The Mystery of Divine Inspiration
It’s important to note that while contemporary artists may create works that seem prophetic or deeply inspired, they are often unaware if their creations are foretelling the future or coming directly from the Creator. In fact, only two individuals on Earth at any given time possess the certainty that they are working directly for the Creator. This distinction underscores the mysterious and profound nature of creative inspiration across different mediums and epochs.

Artists should never be persecuted or killed for their work. Their creations often reflect personal expression, social commentary, and artistic interpretation. Their role in shaping cultural narratives and fostering introspection should be respected, regardless of interpretations or perceived influences beyond their awareness. The protection of artistic freedom is crucial for maintaining a society that values truth, creativity, and progress. Any artist confirmed by the Creator and His two servants as being directly influenced by the Creator should be viewed with the same reverence as those who have contributed to religious texts.

Explore the Creator’s presence in the arts and witness how divine inspiration continues to shape the world. Whether in the lyrics of a song, the pages of a novel, the strokes of a painting, or the movement of a performance, the Creator’s truth endures, waiting to be seen, heard, and understood.
