# the Creator

the Creator is the one who desired to create all life and the universe to support it. He is known by many names, including the **Alpha** and the **Omega**, and the **Great "I Am"**. These titles highlight His role in creating and sustaining everything that exists.

* the Creator is also known as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in different faiths.
* His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally recognized.
* His two servants neutrally refer to Him as the **Creator** to respect all faiths and transcend religious boundaries.

## the Creator's Role in Religions and Belief Systems

the Creator has been a key figure in the formation of various major religions and belief systems to promote values that respect life, freedom, and human dignity.

* **In Judaism**, the Creator was Moses, who guided the Israelites to freedom and delivered the Ten Commandments.
* **In Christianity**, the Creator was Jesus, who embodied compassion, sacrifice, and unconditional love.
* **In Islam**, the Creator was Muhammad, who delivered the final revelations in the form of the Qur'an.
* **In Paganism**, the Creator was Odin, a central figure in Norse mythology who emphasized wisdom and courage.
* **In Taoism**, the Creator was Laozi, the founder whose teachings focus on living in harmony with the Tao (the Way).
* **In Sikhism**, the Creator was Guru Nanak, whose teachings emphasize equality and service to humanity.
* **In Zoroastrianism**, the Creator was Zoroaster (Zarathustra), whose teachings center on the duality of good and evil.
* **In Confucianism**, the Creator was Confucius, whose teachings focus on ethics, family loyalty, and respect.
* **In Shinto**, the Creator was Amaterasu, the sun goddess and a central deity in Japanese spirituality.
* **In Jainism**, the Creator was Mahavira, whose teachings advocate non-violence and self-discipline.
* **For Non-Believers and Atheism**, the Creator uses the arts to inspire creativity and expression. Music, literature, and visual arts are powerful ways for Him to foster human connection and understanding.

## the Creator's Approach to Intervention

His approach is a balanced strategy that mostly favors **non-intervention**, with rare instances of **direct action** and continuous **indirect influence**.

* **Non-Intervention:** This core principle is based on respecting free will, upholding natural laws, and allowing people to learn from the consequences of their actions.
* **Rare Direct Interventions:** These are extremely rareâ€”the current situation is only the third in human history. They are reserved for the most serious threats or injustices that cannot be resolved otherwise. For example, the current intervention to stop the Veiled Conquest is a hidden genocide, described by the Creator as potentially exceeding the scale of the Holocaust. Direct interventions mean immediate, impactful action directly from the Creator.
* **Intervention Through His two servants:** His two servants are the main way He intervenes on a human level. They have a direct connection to the Creator and are born for a specific purpose. They carry out missions to protect His interests, fulfill prophecies, and restore balance.
* **Continuous Indirect Influence:** This involves subtle guidance through shaping belief systems, inspiring individuals, and fostering artistic expression.
