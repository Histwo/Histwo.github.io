**Atlanta, GA –** On **Valentine’s Day 2025**, President Donald J. Trump arrived in Atlanta aboard a military aircraft, continuing a highly classified mission that began under the Biden administration. While very few individuals in either **Atlanta or Washington, D.C.** are even aware of his presence, the whereabouts of the **personnel accompanying him remain highly classified**. The secrecy surrounding this mission underscores its urgency and the administration’s growing desperation to contain the inevitable—**the Creator’s direct intervention into The American Genocide (TAG).**

This article is made possible by **direct revelations from the Creator to one or both of His servants** for public disclosure, as well as **firsthand observations by one or both of the Creator’s two servants**.

## **Golden Rope Prison: The Epicenter of Trump’s Operation**

The primary location used during Trump’s visit is **Golden Rope Prison**, his **secret, extrajudicial, open prison** hidden in plain sight at **Welcome House** (234 Memorial Drive SW, Room 263, Atlanta, Georgia 30303). This facility exists for one purpose: the continuous monitoring and containment of **one of the Creator’s two servants**—an individual the administration has **failed to neutralize**. Operated by the **U.S. Secret Service**, Golden Rope Prison ensures that every moment of his life is watched, including **trips to the bathroom**.

## **A Flawed Litmus Test and Card-Stacking Propaganda**

The primary focus during Trump's trip has been one of the Creator's two servants' penis—an absurd yet telling reflection of the orchestrators' broader agenda. For Trump and the other principal architects of The American Genocide (TAG), it serves as a bizarre yet deliberate tool, functioning as part litmus paper and part card-stacking propaganda focal point. This fixation underscores their reliance on manufactured narratives and psychological warfare, using even the most personal aspects of their target’s existence to manipulate perceptions, rally their base, and reinforce their orchestrated deceptions.

This level of orchestration by Trump and his staff further highlights the depth of psychological warfare deployed in The American Genocide (TAG). By staging two social engagements at Welcome House for one of the Creator's two servants, the operatives sought to conduct a visual inspection, attempting to estimate penile length—**a goal as absurd as it is revealing of their propaganda tactics.**

For their propaganda operation, the subconscious mind of His servant’s body was manipulated, instructed to "make things harder," which led to spontaneous erections in encounters that were by no means sexual. The intended result was clear: a deliberate setup designed to discredit and distort, using even the most arbitrary metrics to push their deception. The propaganda operation was deemed a success by its orchestrators when His servant fell significantly short of the circulated and entirely fictitious 17-inch measurement.

Yet, the Creator’s response to such tactics was foreseen long ago. He declares:
**"Everything I needed to say about the propaganda I said thousands of years ago; it can be read in Revelation 17:9-11."**

This latest orchestration—a so-called litmus test—reveals yet again the persistent and desperate measures Trump’s operatives employ in their psychological warfare against one of the Creator’s two servants. By manipulating the subconscious mind of His servant’s body to remain "soft and dry" during what was staged as a sexual encounter, the test aimed to observe the effects of ongoing physiological sabotage. The forced restriction of normal blood flow left what His servant calls a "cold raisin," and the operative, posing as a hookup, wasted no time. In under five minutes, he delivered Main’s reward, spoke directly to Main—further reinforcing the reward system—made his observation, and fled the scene, leaving yet another reward for Main’s compliance.

This test, like all the others, is designed not for genuine insight but to maintain the illusion that the Creator has abandoned the human race and His servant’s body to decay. His servant remarks:

> **"I don’t understand why they even do this test. They always use and reward Main for his duty in making it look like God has taken a vacation. Yet, they persist, sadly, before every orchestration. And no matter what I say, operatives are told to ignore me. This one almost fell trying to run out of my room."**

Yet, the reality is far greater than their delusions. The fifth seal—the Martyrs' Cry—has already been broken. His servant recounts:

> **"I talked to the Boss afterward, and He said, ‘I heard them!’ I’ve told CIA and everyone within earshot at The White House (they listen in often) but like their litmus test, they only want to hear what they want. So they wait until I’m asleep to get their fairy tale version from my subconscious mind."**

Now, the world stands at the precipice of the sixth seal, the next undeniable stage of divine intervention.

> **"Seal #6 is about to be broken. There’s no need for a litmus test. They just need to RTFM because He hasn’t deviated from it once. The prophecy in Revelation is what I’m talking about. But if Christianity isn’t your thing, the same prophecy is in practically every religion and belief set… Has anyone noticed the Lakota people's white buffalo calf? It is not albino."**

The signs are manifesting. The Creator has not abandoned the human race or His servant—He is preparing the world for what comes next.

## **Trump Remains in Atlanta as the Intervention Continues**

As of **Monday, February 17, at 4:00 p.m.**, President Donald Trump **is still in Atlanta**. Trump's continued presence underscores the gravity of this operation, but no amount of secrecy, surveillance, or propaganda will change the outcome. The Creator’s intervention is not a question of **“if”** but **“when.”**
