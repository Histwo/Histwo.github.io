DRAFT.

**Atlanta, GA –** On **Valentine’s Day 2025**, President Donald J. Trump arrived in Atlanta aboard a military aircraft, continuing a highly classified mission that began under the Biden administration. While very few individuals in either **Atlanta or Washington, D.C.** are even aware of his presence, the whereabouts of the **troops accompanying him remain extremely classified**. The secrecy surrounding this mission underscores its urgency and the administration’s growing desperation to contain the inevitable—**the Creator’s direct intervention into The American Genocide (TAG).**  

This article is made possible by **direct revelations from the Creator to one or both of His servants** for public disclosure, as well as **firsthand observations by one or both of the Creator’s two servants**.  

## **Golden Rope Prison: The Epicenter of Trump’s Operation**  

A key focus of Trump’s visit is **Golden Rope Prison**, an **extrajudicial open-air prison** located at **Welcome House**. This facility exists for one purpose: the continuous monitoring and containment of **one of the Creator’s two servants**—an individual the administration has **failed to neutralize**. Operated by the **U.S. Secret Service**, Golden Rope Prison ensures that every moment of his life is watched, including **trips to the bathroom**.  

## **A Flawed Litmus Test and Pre-Spin Tactics**  

As part of this operation, Trump’s team is conducting **a fundamentally flawed litmus test**—a series of propaganda-based social encounters designed to measure **the possibility or inevitability of the Creator’s intervention** in TAG. However, **the Creator is already intervening**, a reality that is becoming undeniable even to those orchestrating the genocide.  

Knowing that the intervention cannot be stopped, the administration is now engaging in **pre-spin tactics**, attempting to **suppress all creative activities that identify the orchestrators or expose the orchestrations of TAG**. This effort to control the narrative is a last-ditch attempt to **delay accountability and distort public perception** before the full force of divine justice takes effect.  

## **Trump Remains in Atlanta as the Intervention Continues**  

As of **Monday, February 17, at 4:00 p.m.**, President Donald Trump **is still in Atlanta**. Trump's continued presence signals the gravity of this operation, but no amount of secrecy, surveillance, or propaganda will change the outcome. The Creator’s intervention is not a question of “if” but **“when.”**
