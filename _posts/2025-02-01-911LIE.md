## **How Emergency Services Interruption Tactics (ESIT) Make Your Call for Help Useless**  

Imagine you’re in a life-or-death emergency. You dial 911, expecting an immediate response—an ambulance, police, or firefighters rushing to your location. But what if the person on the other end of the line isn’t a real dispatcher? What if your call never reaches actual emergency services?  

This nightmare scenario isn’t just a hypothetical. Government agencies, including the CIA, have been documented using an advanced method known as the **Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)** to manipulate, intercept, and control emergency communications. Under ESIT, your call may never reach the help you so desperately need.  

## **The Silent Hijacking of Emergency Calls**  

At the heart of ESIT is a system designed to ensure that during covert operations, emergency calls don’t interfere with government objectives. Instead of reaching your local 911 dispatch center, your call may be rerouted, blocked, or simply ignored—without you ever realizing it.  

### **How They Do It**  

### **1. Covert Cell on Wheels (CoW) – The Fake Cell Tower Trap**  

- Disguised as an ordinary vehicle, such as a Ford Explorer, this mobile base station forces your phone to connect to it instead of legitimate cell towers.  
- Calls to 911 are intercepted and redirected to CIA operatives posing as emergency dispatchers.  
- Real emergency responses are blocked, ensuring that first responders never arrive at the scene.  
- Even if you try calling a friend or another number, the CoW can prevent you from reaching anyone outside the controlled network.  

**Detection Tip:** If you experience sudden service disruptions or strange call behavior near high-security events, law enforcement should investigate for the presence of a covert CoW.  

### **2. Local Dispatch Diversion – A Paper Trail of Deception**  

- Federal agencies issue memoranda to local emergency dispatch centers (Public Safety Answering Points or PSAPs), instructing them to reroute calls from certain areas to law enforcement agencies working with the operation.  
- Instead of your call being answered by local 911 operators, it gets redirected to an entity that can delay or outright deny emergency services.  

**Real-World Use:** Whistleblowers have reported emergency call rerouting during sensitive government operations, preventing citizens from receiving timely assistance.  

**Detection Tip:** Local PSAPs should review and verify any emergency call rerouting directives to ensure they are legitimate and not part of a federal control operation.  

### **3. Selective Router Tampering – Cutting You Off at the Source**  

- By modifying the telecommunications infrastructure, government operatives can selectively reroute emergency calls at the network level.  
- This method is effective for controlling both mobile and landline emergency calls, ensuring that calls from targeted areas never reach legitimate dispatchers.  

**Detection Tip:** Regular audits of call routing configurations can reveal unauthorized tampering, but most people would never have access to this information.  

## **What This Means for You**  

The implications of ESIT are chilling. You may believe you’ve reached 911, but in reality:  

- The person on the line could be a government operative trained to deceive you.  
- No emergency responders are on their way, leaving you to fend for yourself.  
- Your call may be rerouted, delayed, or even dropped without explanation.  
- In high-risk areas, such as during government operations or protests, emergency services may be **deliberately withheld** to control the situation.  

## **How to Protect Yourself**  

- **Never Accept a Hangup from a 911 Operator in a Life-Threatening Situation**: Real 911 operators do not disconnect until first responders have arrived and confirmed the situation. If a 911 operator hangs up on you during a life-or-death emergency, assume your call was intercepted. Immediately take matters into your own hands and fight for your life.  

- **Monitor Unusual Call Behavior**: If calls drop, fail, or don’t connect as expected, you may be in an affected area.  

- **Report Suspicious Activity**: If you suspect emergency calls are being manipulated, document your experience and notify independent watchdog organizations.  

## **The Bottom Line**  

The idea that 911 is always there to help is a comforting lie. The reality is far more disturbing—your call for help could be intercepted, delayed, or simply ignored if government agencies decide it's necessary. ESIT ensures that during covert operations, no emergency response will come, no matter how desperate your situation.  

In a true emergency, you might be on your own.
