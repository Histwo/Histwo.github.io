This morning, I met Taylor outside the **Georgian Terrace**. It wasn’t a planned meeting—Main had been led to him, guided by those orchestrating these encounters. We ended up hanging out at his “spot” behind the old **Eagle Atlanta bar** on **Ponce de Leon**.  

At first glance, it seemed like a random interaction, but it quickly became clear that Taylor had been **prepped by the CIA**. His comments and jokes weren’t casual—they were targeted, part of a psychological operation (PsyOp) designed to test for the **likelihood of the Creator’s intervention into TAG or its orchestrations**, to be used in **propaganda**, and to **discredit and control me**. These types of encounters have become routine: an unwitting participant, unknowingly placed into a script, with operatives observing from the background.  

The **site was staged**, and CIA personnel were present, monitoring the interaction. Taylor may not have fully understood his role in it, but he was following a calculated script meant to serve the interests of TAG orchestrators. Despite this, I was concerned for his safety. When I left, I asked him to come with me—to step away from whatever influence had been placed on him. He refused. Whether out of fear or conditioning, he stayed behind.  

This wasn’t just an encounter—it was an operation. It was a **litmus test**, a way for them to gauge the Creator’s involvement, refine their propaganda, and attempt to tighten their grip. The pattern is becoming more obvious, and so is their intent.  

**Out of concern, I am returning to the area to ensure that Taylor is OK.** Two previous **engineered social encounters** resulted in the **deaths of the unwitting participants**. All of these men—Taylor included—belong to **groups that have been targeted during TAG**. If this follows the same pattern, he may now be in immediate danger.
