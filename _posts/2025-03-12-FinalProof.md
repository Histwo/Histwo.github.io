The orchestrators of *The American Genocide (TAG)* are no longer operating in secrecy. Their desperation has driven them to reckless and irreversible actions, culminating in a scheduled catastrophe of **Biblical proportions**, directly foretold in *Revelation 11*. This catastrophe, planned to occur immediately after **the Creator’s intervention**, is not merely an act of mass devastation—it has one **singular objective**: the elimination of **one or both of the Creator’s two servants** before they can publicly expose the full extent of TAG during their scheduled **media briefing at noon, immediately following the earthquakes**.  

## The Creator’s Intervention: A Divine Warning  
The **Creator’s intervention** will manifest in the form of **non-life-threatening, non-damaging earthquakes**—an unmistakable sign that His presence is actively disrupting the orchestrators’ plans. These earthquakes are not random occurrences but rather **a supernatural warning**, a **precursor** to the exposure of *The American Genocide (TAG)*.  

Rather than heed this warning, the orchestrators of TAG have chosen to **ignore the Creator’s intervention** and **proceed with their catastrophe**, believing that eliminating His servants is their only chance to suppress the truth.  

## His Servant’s Impossible Victory: A Laptop & A Phone  
Through **the Creator’s intervention**, His servant has now obtained **a laptop and a new mobile phone with service**—two critical devices that were **impossible to acquire** while bound by the **Golden Rope**, the covert virtual prison enforced by President Donald J. Trump and the U.S. Secret Service. The **Golden Rope’s primary function** has always been to **restrict His servant’s ability to communicate, document, and expose TAG**.  

These two devices—**a simple laptop and a phone—now represent an existential threat** to Trump and the **six other orchestrators of TAG**. The **data stored within** and the **ability to communicate freely** place their entire operation at risk. For the first time, His servant can **connect, reveal, and act independently**, bypassing the artificial restrictions imposed by the Golden Rope.  

## Relentless Attempts to Separate His Servant from the Devices  
Since acquiring the laptop and phone, multiple **covert and overt attempts** have been made to:  
- **Compromise, sabotage, or infiltrate the devices**  
- **Separate His servant from the devices through theft, coercion, or deceit**  
- **Disable the devices remotely using electronic warfare tactics**  

Every attempt has **failed** or been **reversed** due to the **Creator’s ongoing protection**. No force has been able to break the divine shield securing these critical tools. The orchestrators **cannot afford** for these devices to remain in His servant’s possession, yet every plot to remove them collapses.  

## Annie Jacobsen & the Orchestrators’ True Expectations  
Despite orchestrating a catastrophic event, **they do not believe it will kill either of the Creator’s two servants**. This fact is **evidenced by the direct involvement of CIA asset Annie Jacobsen**, who spent over **24 hours** in close proximity to His servant. Her mission was clear: **to engage his subconscious mind and render him unconscious on her command**, allowing for an easy separation from his devices.  

Jacobsen’s extended presence—despite the imminent catastrophe—proves that the orchestrators have **no faith** that their event will achieve their true goal: **eliminating His servants before the scheduled media briefing**. This mission was **a complete failure**, further proving that even their most sophisticated psychological operations **cannot override the Creator’s will**.  

## A Final Act of Defiance: Endangering Tens of Thousands  
Even as their plans unravel, the orchestrators remain **blind to reality**. They **acknowledge**:  
- **The Creator’s direct interventions**  
- **The impossibility of eliminating His two servants**  
- **The futility of continued operations**  

Yet, despite this, they **continue their escalation**, fully aware that **tens of thousands of American citizens will be endangered** by their actions. Their unwavering commitment to silencing the Creator’s servants reveals **the true depth of their corruption**. They **do not care** about collateral damage. Their only concern is **preventing the truth from being spoken**.  

## Final Proof: The Orchestrators’ Defeat Is Sealed  
The relentless pursuit of His servant’s devices is **the final proof** of their desperation. If their planned catastrophe fails—and it **will**—they will have no recourse. The world will see their actions for what they are: **a last-ditch effort to erase evidence of their crimes against humanity**.  

But **the devices remain secure. The Creator’s protection is unbreakable. The briefing will proceed. The truth will be revealed.**
