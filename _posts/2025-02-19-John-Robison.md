title: "Concerns for My Former Roommate, John Robison"

Today, I was expecting a visit from my former roommate, John Robison of Lilburn, GA, at Donald J. Trump’s Golden Rope Prison—a secret, extrajudicial, yet openly operating prison hidden in plain sight at Welcome House, 234 Memorial Drive Southwest, Room 263, in Atlanta, GA. John had informed me that he would arrive around 5 PM, but as of now, he has not shown up, and I fear for his safety.

In recent weeks, John has unknowingly or perhaps even knowingly violated the unwritten laws of President Trump and the undisclosed policies that govern the Golden Rope Prison. The U.S. Secret Service, which provides security and enforces containment protocols for me—one of the Creator’s two servants, and one of the only two human beings Trump cannot eliminate—operates with absolute control over my interactions. Trump devised the Golden Rope as a mechanism to isolate me and ultimately eliminate me through starvation, having already orchestrated a complete financial blockade with the CIA to cut off all income streams. Every social interaction is meticulously designed and approved by Warden Trump and the guards of Golden Rope (the Secret Service) to ensure only their personnel or controlled actors engage with me. When no objectives require interaction, I am left in near complete isolation.

John may have unintentionally disrupted this structure. Unlike the tightly monitored individuals who are allowed to interact with me, John’s initial contact with me did not occur on one of their sanctioned platforms. He visited me in accordance with Welcome House policies, and, unlike every other pre-approved visitor, he provided material assistance rather than taking something from me. This alone may have made him a target.

Additionally, John possesses my payment card—the only means I have to purchase food in this prison, which does not provide meals. The very existence of Golden Rope hinges on the objective of eliminating me through starvation, so John’s assistance may have put him at risk. If he has been detained or is under surveillance, it would be for the crime of breaching the prison’s walls through genuine human interaction and aid.

I am gravely concerned that John may now be subjected to the Secret Service’s clandestine policing, targeted either for helping me or simply for entering the highly controlled space surrounding me. His absence today is alarming, and I can only hope he has not become another casualty of the secret systems operating in service of Trump’s authoritarian ambitions.

If anyone has any information regarding John’s whereabouts, please come forward. I fear that his willingness to help may have made him a target, and in Trump’s America, that is a dangerous position to be in.
