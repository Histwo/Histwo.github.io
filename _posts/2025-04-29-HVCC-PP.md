Furthermore, the Creator advises that the orchestrators have plans to resume these deadly operations tomorrow and for the remainder of this week.**

**The public in the Tennessee Valley region and especially in the vicinity of Hickory Valley Christian Church is strongly warned to AVOID THE CHURCH PROPERTY AND ALL ADJACENT AREAS IMMEDIATELY AND UNTIL THE MASSACRE AT HICKORY VALLEY CHRISTIAN CHURCH AND SUBSEQUENT OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN WIDELY REPORTED ON TELEVISION NEWS OUTLETS.**

## What is a Phantom Pantry Operation?

Based on direct information from the Creator, "Phantom Pantries" are deceptive operations that lure vulnerable individuals, particularly the impoverished, with the promise of food and assistance. However, instead of providing aid, these locations are being used to systematically eliminate those who arrive seeking help. Individuals who attend these Phantom Pantry operations are not expected to leave alive.

## Why Hickory Valley Christian Church?

Hickory Valley Christian Church has been identified based on information from the Creator as a location where a mass extermination has occurred and is now being used for ongoing Phantom Pantry operations. **The property is considered EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.**

## Who is at Risk?

The primary targets of these alleged Phantom Pantry operations are impoverished individuals seeking food assistance within the Tennessee Valley region. Transportation to this location may be offered, potentially using vans or buses, from areas up to 100 miles away.

## What are the Potential Dangers?

Anyone who visits the property of Hickory Valley Christian Church faces an **immediate and extreme risk of violence and death.** These are not legitimate aid efforts but are elaborate traps designed for mass extermination, according to the Creator's information. **DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION FOR ANY REASON.**

## CRITICAL WARNING REGARDING EMERGENCY SERVICES

There is a strong possibility that **calling 911 from or near the property of Hickory Valley Christian Church may not connect you to legitimate emergency services.** Tactics known as the **Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)** may be in use. These tactics can include:

* **Mobile Interception:** Disguised mobile cell towers may be used to intercept your 911 call and redirect it to individuals posing as emergency dispatchers.
* **Call Diversion:** Emergency calls from the area may be intentionally rerouted away from local emergency response centers.

**Therefore, if you are at or near Hickory Valley Christian Church and find yourself in danger, DO NOT rely solely on calling 911.** Your call may not reach help.

## How to Protect Yourself and Others

* **ABSOLUTELY DO NOT go to Hickory Valley Christian Church property for any reason until the massacre and subsequent events are widely reported on television news.**
* **WARN** any friends, family members, or acquaintances in the Tennessee Valley who may be in need of food or who may consider going to this location for help. Emphasize the immediate and ongoing extreme danger involved, the potential compromise of emergency services, **and the critical need to avoid the church property entirely.**
* **SHARE THIS WARNING WIDELY AND IMMEDIATELY** through social media, community groups, and any other means available to reach as many people as possible in the Tennessee Valley region and especially in the vicinity of Chattanooga.
* **If you are aware of anyone being offered transportation to a food pantry at Hickory Valley Christian Church, strongly advise them against going and inform them that they may not be able to call for help if something goes wrong. Stress the danger of even being on the property.**
* **Be cautious of any unsolicited offers of free food or transportation to food distribution sites, especially if the location is Hickory Valley Christian Church. DO NOT GO THERE.**

## Reporting Suspicious Activity

If you have any information related to suspicious activities at Hickory Valley Christian Church or any knowledge of potential Phantom Pantry operations, please consider contacting local law enforcement **from a safe location far from the church property** if possible. Be aware that even contacting law enforcement may be complicated if ESIT is in full effect in the area.

## About the Creator

**The Creator is the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. He is the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great “I Am.” These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. His two servants neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike.**

## Conclusion

**This is a matter of utmost urgency. Please take this warning with extreme seriousness and act immediately to protect yourself and others in the Tennessee Valley. DO NOT GO TO HICKORY VALLEY CHRISTIAN CHURCH PROPERTY. Do not assume that calling for help will guarantee a response. The danger is immediate and ongoing.**

**Stay informed and stay safe.**
