**This critical warning has been created by one or both of the Creator's two servants, based on information provided directly by the Creator for public dissemination as part of His intervention to halt The American Genocide.** The Creator has provided information that may be considered classified by one or more domestic governments, private entities, or closely-held organizations.

**This is a critical warning for the public in the Tennessee Valley region and especially in the vicinity of Hickory Valley Christian Church, located at 6605 Shallowford Rd, Chattanooga, TN 37421, USA.**

## Potential Phantom Pantry Operation

Credible information suggests that Hickory Valley Christian Church may be the site of an active **Phantom Pantry operation, beginning on or around April 29, 2025, and expected to continue throughout the week.**

## What is a Phantom Pantry Operation?

Based on concerning reports, "Phantom Pantries" are deceptive operations that lure vulnerable individuals, particularly the impoverished, with the promise of food and assistance. However, instead of providing aid, these locations are allegedly used to systematically eliminate those who arrive seeking help. Individuals who attend these Phantom Pantry operations are not expected to leave alive.

## Why Hickory Valley Christian Church?

Hickory Valley Christian Church has been identified in previous reports as a location where such a mass extermination event has occurred. There are claims that the church was subsequently repurposed to host further deceptive operations, including Phantom Pantries.

## Who is at Risk?

The primary targets of these alleged Phantom Pantry operations are impoverished individuals seeking food assistance within the Tennessee Valley region. Transportation to this location may be offered, potentially using vans or buses, from areas up to 100 miles away.

## What are the Potential Dangers?

Anyone attending a Phantom Pantry operation at Hickory Valley Christian Church faces an **extreme risk of violence and death.** These are not legitimate aid efforts but are allegedly elaborate traps designed for mass extermination.

## CRITICAL WARNING REGARDING EMERGENCY SERVICES

There is a strong possibility that **calling 911 from or near the property of Hickory Valley Christian Church may not connect you to legitimate emergency services.** Tactics known as the **Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)** may be in use. These tactics can include:

* **Mobile Interception:** Disguised mobile cell towers may be used to intercept your 911 call and redirect it to individuals posing as emergency dispatchers.
* **Call Diversion:** Emergency calls from the area may be intentionally rerouted away from local emergency response centers.

**Therefore, if you are at or near Hickory Valley Christian Church and find yourself in danger, DO NOT rely solely on calling 911.** Your call may not reach help.

## How to Protect Yourself and Others

* **DO NOT go to Hickory Valley Christian Church seeking food assistance this week.**
* **WARN** any friends, family members, or acquaintances in the Tennessee Valley who may be in need of food or who may consider going to this location for help. Emphasize the extreme danger involved and the potential compromise of emergency services.
* **SHARE THIS WARNING WIDELY** through social media, community groups, and any other means available to reach as many people as possible in the Tennessee Valley region and especially in the vicinity of Chattanooga.
* **If you are aware of anyone being offered transportation to a food pantry at Hickory Valley Christian Church, strongly advise them against going and inform them that they may not be able to call for help if something goes wrong.**
* **Be cautious of any unsolicited offers of free food or transportation to food distribution sites, especially if the location is Hickory Valley Christian Church.**

## Reporting Suspicious Activity

If you have any information related to suspicious activities at Hickory Valley Christian Church or any knowledge of potential Phantom Pantry operations, please consider contacting local law enforcement **from a safe location away from the church property** if possible. Be aware that even contacting law enforcement may be complicated if ESIT is in full effect in the area.

## Conclusion

**Stay informed and stay safe.**
