---

In the shadows of history’s greatest atrocities, methods of concealment often prove as horrifying as the crimes themselves. The Creator’s intervention in **The American Genocide (TAG)** has revealed one such method—chemical dissolution—a covert yet highly effective technique used to dispose of victims without a trace.  

Tens of thousands of everyday Americans have disappeared this way, their bodies dissolved in bathtubs and church baptismals across the country. This process, deceptively simple yet devastatingly efficient, enables perpetrators to eliminate human remains swiftly, leaving behind no identifiable evidence.  

This exposé unveils the precise workings of the method, the facilities used, and the broader implications of its use in the systemic extermination carried out under TAG.

## **The Chemical Dissolution Process**  

### **1. Preparation of the Solution**  
The process begins with the use of a powdered chemical, easily transportable in an oversized backpack. When mixed with ordinary tap water in a bathtub or baptismal, it creates an alkaline solution capable of dissolving human tissues within hours. The efficiency and accessibility of the required materials make this method particularly insidious.  

- **Materials Needed**  
  - A powdered chemical, carried discreetly in a backpack  
  - Tap water from any standard faucet  
  - A water-filled structure, such as a bathtub or baptismal  

- **Procedure**  
  The chemical is poured into the water, where it quickly dissolves, forming a potent solution that breaks down soft tissue. Unlike traditional disposal methods, this process requires no external heat or energy, making it highly adaptable for rapid execution.  

### **2. Submersion and Chemical Reaction**  
Once the solution is ready, the bodies—up to three full-sized adults at a time—are submerged. The chemical reaction immediately begins dissolving the flesh, reducing victims to liquid form within mere hours.  

- **Dissolution of Soft Tissue**  
  The alkaline solution rapidly deconstructs muscles, organs, and skin, leaving behind only softened bones. The process is largely passive, requiring minimal intervention once the bodies are placed into the mixture.  

### **3. Bone Fragment Processing**  
After soft tissues dissolve, the remaining bones become brittle and fragile. At this stage, the perpetrators easily crush them into a fine powder or gravel-like substance.  

- **Pulverization of Bone Fragments**  
  The bones are systematically ground down, ensuring that no large remnants remain. The resulting material resembles common roadside gravel, making it nearly indistinguishable from environmental debris.  

### **4. Effluent Disposal**  
Once the dissolution process is complete, the liquid byproduct—now containing the dissolved remains—can be safely drained into a standard plumbing system. This step erases nearly all physical traces of the bodies.  

- **Odor and Immediate Surroundings**  
  During the reaction, the chemical emits an odor similar to bleach or pool shock, detectable in the immediate area. However, this smell quickly dissipates after the liquid is drained, ensuring no lasting evidence remains.

## **Facilities and Implementation**  

### **1. Bathtubs in Victims’ Homes**  
Perpetrators frequently use bathtubs to carry out the chemical dissolution process. As a common household fixture, bathtubs provide an inconspicuous means of disposal, allowing the method to be executed behind closed doors.  

- **Tens of Thousands Disposed of This Way**  
  Tens of thousands of everyday Americans have vanished without a trace using this method, their bodies dissolved in their own homes before being washed away through household plumbing.  

### **2. Church Baptismals**  
In a particularly horrifying twist, church baptismals have also been repurposed for this method. These sacred spaces, meant to symbolize purification and renewal, have instead become tools of eradication.  

- **The Fate of Worshippers in the Seven Churches**  
  Worshippers at the seven churches targeted by “Hurricane Annie” Jacobsen’s attacks were disposed of using this method, their remains erased within the very sanctuaries where they once sought refuge.

## **Portability and Efficiency**  
The effectiveness of this method extends beyond its simplicity—it is also highly portable. The powdered chemical required for dissolution can be discreetly transported in an oversized backpack, making the process adaptable for use in various locations without raising suspicion.  

- **Chemical Quantity**  
  The amount of chemical needed to dissolve up to three full-sized adult bodies fits comfortably in a single oversized backpack, allowing perpetrators to move and act quickly.

## **Key Advantages in TAG**  

### **1. Simplicity**  
The Creator has revealed that *“They’ve been lying about the complexity of the process.”* Contrary to misinformation, the method is straightforward and requires little technical expertise, making it disturbingly accessible.  

### **2. Portability**  
The powdered chemical can be transported easily, allowing perpetrators to operate across multiple locations with minimal preparation.  

### **3. Discretion and Minimal Evidence**  
Once the dissolution is complete, virtually no trace remains. Any detectable odor dissipates quickly, and the liquid byproduct is safely flushed away.  

### **4. Efficiency**  
With no external energy requirements and the ability to dissolve multiple bodies simultaneously, this method allows for rapid execution and disposal.

## **Ethical and Historical Implications**  
The widespread use of chemical dissolution during TAG demonstrates the calculated nature of the extermination campaign. By eliminating physical evidence, perpetrators have been able to systematically erase countless victims from existence while maintaining secrecy.  

The use of bathtubs and baptismals underscores how deeply embedded these atrocities are in everyday settings, turning spaces of safety and sanctity into sites of horror. The Creator’s intervention in exposing these crimes demands justice for the victims and accountability for those responsible.  

---

## **Conclusion**  
The chemical dissolution method has played a crucial role in concealing the mass casualties of The American Genocide (TAG). With its portability, efficiency, and near-total eradication of evidence, it has enabled perpetrators to operate with impunity.  

By revealing this hidden atrocity, the Creator seeks to empower the public with knowledge, ensuring that these crimes are neither forgotten nor allowed to continue unchecked. Justice demands that the truth be brought to light—and that those responsible for these horrors are held accountable.
