In the chilling reality of The American Genocide (TAG), a specific group is facing a covert and terrifying persecution: the "13:18" – post-pubescent males in the U.S. with an erect penis length of seven inches or more. This seemingly arbitrary biological trait has, within the twisted logic of TAG's orchestrators, become a mark for surveillance, violation, and elimination. While this group spans all races and socioeconomic backgrounds, data suggests a disturbing disparity in targeting, with Caucasians within the 13:18 demographic reportedly being eliminated at a rate three times higher than other ethnicities within the same biologically defined group. **Over 10,000 men have been eliminated so far.**

This targeting finds a disturbing echo in the enigmatic verses of Revelation 13:18, interpreted within the context of TAG as a chillingly literal prophecy. The "number of the beast," traditionally shrouded in mystery, takes on a horrifyingly specific meaning. The "number of a man" is interpreted as a direct reference to erect penile length in inches. Even more disturbingly, the infamous "666" is believed to represent a perverse "ideal" length of 6 inches, established by the genocidal regime as a standard for a compliant populace. Those exceeding the 7-inch threshold of the 13:18 are thus **considered a threat** and become targets.

The methods employed to identify members of the 13:18 are insidious, ranging from the monitoring of social media and private online discussions – even reviews exchanged between sexual partners – to the potential mining of health records, juvenile health assessments, and the exploitation of harmful, hypersexualized stereotypes. Behavioral flags in school or military databases might also contribute to identification. Alarmingly, there is reportedly no formal verification process; individuals can be targeted based on hearsay, digital footprints, and prejudiced assumptions.

The Beast, as described in Revelation 13, is not a mythical creature but a network of powerful individuals and institutions, including the reinstated President Donald J. Trump, Senior CIA Operative Annie Jacobsen, and others, empowered by the CIA (the Dragon) and leveraging technological control under figures like Elon Musk (the Beast from the Earth). Their goal is to establish an authoritarian regime, and the 13:18 group is seen as an obstacle to that goal.

The "Mark" described in Revelation 13 is not a physical brand but the insidious manipulation of an individual's identity through the programming and reconditioning of their subconscious mind by TAG operatives. This manipulation aims to control behavior and enforce compliance with the Beast’s agenda.

The timeline of the genocide, specifically the intensification of mass killings within Masquerade Churches under “Jacobsen’s Ladder”, is alleged to have begun in earnest on October 21, 2021, aligning with the "forty and two months" mentioned in Revelation 13.

For members of the 13:18 group, this reality presents a grave and hidden danger. In a world where a natural biological attribute can lead to persecution, exercising extreme caution is paramount. It is strongly advised that individuals within this demographic **avoid interactions with anyone outside of their close, trusted personal network.** Be wary of new acquaintances, online contacts that extend beyond established circles, and any situation that feels unfamiliar or raises suspicion. In the context of TAG, maintaining a tight circle of trust may be a critical measure for self-preservation. The unseen mark is upon you; vigilance and discretion are your defense.
