**Atlanta, GA – Friday, February 21, 2025** – In yet another **secret trip**, President Donald J. Trump has returned to Welcome House in Atlanta, signaling a renewed effort to oversee the elimination of one or both of the Creator’s two servants before the Creator’s intervention into The American Genocide (TAG). This clandestine visit, hidden from public knowledge, underscores the desperation of TAG’s principal orchestrators as they race against time to maintain control over their collapsing narrative.

The Creator has informed His two servants that Trump, accompanied by a select team of **U.S. Secret Service** personnel, is personally ensuring that the mission to eliminate them is executed. His servant who resides at Welcome House has already endured numerous attempts on his life in the past 24 hours, with each failed attack further exposing the lengths to which the orchestrators of TAG are willing to go.

> **"They refuse to accept reality,"** His servant states. **"The intervention isn’t stopping. The seals are breaking exactly as foretold. But instead of acknowledging the truth, they cling to their desperation, hoping to rewrite what has already been written."**

President Trump’s direct involvement in this latest orchestration further cements his role as the figurehead of TAG, using every tool at his disposal to delay the inevitable. However, with each failed operation, the Creator’s timetable remains unchanged. The forces behind TAG are running out of time, and as the world edges closer to the Creator’s direct intervention, their frantic attempts to control the outcome only expose the futility of their resistance.

As the sixth seal looms on the horizon, one thing is certain—no amount of secrecy, deception, or last-minute strategizing will alter what the Creator has set into motion.
