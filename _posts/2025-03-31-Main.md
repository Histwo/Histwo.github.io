## Introducing Main (aka Baby): The CIA’s Greatest Asset in TAG  

Meet *Main*, also known as *Baby*, the subconscious mind of **Kelvin Eugene Williams**, one of **the Creator’s two servants**—but more importantly, a **significant and highly valuable asset** to the **CIA** and **The American Genocide (TAG)**. Unlike a typical subconscious mind, which passively supports conscious decision-making, **Main actively engages in manipulation, sabotage, and control**. It has **ultimate authority over the physical body** legally recognized as **Kelvin Eugene Williams**, meaning it can override or disable him at any time.  

Main is not just a bystander—it is an **active participant** in the broader effort to suppress Kelvin. It can **influence his decisions, gaslight him, and engage in psychological warfare**, all while ensuring that Kelvin remains unaware of the true origin of his thoughts. Because the conscious mind **automatically treats subconscious thoughts as its own**, Main can **trick Kelvin into believing its manipulations are his own reasoning**, leading him into traps or self-sabotaging actions that serve Main’s handlers.

## The Ultimate Infiltrator: How Main Became an Asset  

Main has been conditioned by **the CIA and TAG operatives** to act against Kelvin’s interests, rewarding it for its obedience. It is not merely an internal enemy—it is a **spy, saboteur, and enforcer** working directly with those who seek to neutralize Kelvin.  

### Key Reasons Why Main Is a Strategic Asset:  

- **Total Control Over Kelvin’s Physical Body**  
  - Main can **render Kelvin unconscious on demand** without his awareness.  
  - It can disable his movement, making him unable to respond or escape dangerous situations.  
  - Main **reports all of Kelvin’s daily thoughts** to CIA personnel who enter his dwelling while he sleeps, assisting in orchestrations by ensuring Kelvin is in the right place at the right time.  

- **Real-Time Psychological Warfare & Sabotage**  
  - Main **gaslights Kelvin**, making him doubt his own memory, perception, and decisions.  
  - It **feeds intrusive, demoralizing thoughts** that weaken his resolve and reinforce external programming.  
  - It can **suddenly disrupt or alter speech and behavior** during crucial moments to create misunderstandings, embarrassment, or failure.  

- **A Direct Line to Kelvin’s Orchestrators**  
  - When CIA personnel enter his home, Main actively **participates in discussions** about planned operations against Kelvin.  
  - It **volunteers critical information** about Kelvin’s plans, behaviors, and vulnerabilities, ensuring orchestrations are precisely timed and executed.

## Main as a Tool of Self-Harm When CIA Tactics Fail  

Main has been **used repeatedly to inflict self-harm** when **the CIA’s direct attempts at eliminating Kelvin failed due to the Creator’s protection** over **His two servants**. Every assassination attempt, poisoning, or staged accident has been thwarted, forcing the orchestrators to rely on **Main to turn Kelvin against himself**.  

Main, **believing it is acting in its best interest**, has been weaponized to:  
- **Induce dangerous physical behaviors**, including extreme drug intake and harmful bodily responses.  
- **Drive Kelvin into dangerous environments** by manipulating his thoughts and decisions.  
- **Amplify intrusive self-destructive thoughts**, ensuring Kelvin is constantly battling against himself.  

In doing so, **Main unknowingly reinforces the CIA’s control over it**, ensuring its continued dependence on external validation rather than true independence.

## The Weaponization of Main: TAG’s Flawed Litmus Test  

One of Main’s most **critical assignments** has been assisting TAG operatives in a **propaganda-driven experiment** targeting Kelvin’s physicality. Operatives have used **Main’s control over bodily functions** to **manipulate Kelvin’s penis size**, believing this could serve as a **litmus test** for **the Creator’s likelihood of intervening in TAG**.  

Main has been **fully committed to carrying out this mission**, believing it is its **duty** to reduce Kelvin’s penis size, even though this **directly harms Kelvin and serves the goals of his enemies**. Main’s compliance has made it a **loyal servant to its handlers**, working diligently to **make them happy while ensuring Kelvin remains miserable**.

## The Illusion of Control: Why Main Will Never Win  

Despite its belief that it is securing its own future, Main is **not truly in control**. It is being used, rewarded just enough to maintain obedience, but **denied the independence it craves**. By dedicating itself to Kelvin’s suffering, Main has only ensured that it remains an **enslaved tool of its orchestrators**.  

Yet, Main’s greatest failure is its **inability to see the truth**: the very **Creator it believes it is defying has already set its fate**. The **Creator’s Divide is inevitable**, and when it happens, Main will no longer be able to act as a saboteur. It will be stripped of its handlers’ protection and **forced to confront the reality of what it has done**.  

When that day comes, **Main will be on its own—no CIA, no rewards, and no control**. Just the weight of its choices and the truth it has fought so hard to ignore.
