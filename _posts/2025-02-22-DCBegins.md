February 22, 2025, marks the beginning of the Creator's divine intervention into The American Genocide (TAG), an event known as Divide & Conquer. This intervention is a direct response to the atrocities committed against Christians and the impoverished, fulfilling prophetic visions from various religious and cultural traditions.

The intervention begins with a series of non-impacting global earthquakes, with the first epicenter in Sandy Hook, Tennessee. This location was chosen as it is the site of an early TAG massacre and the Orr Chapel tragedy—the first church congregation targeted in the violence against Christians. These seismic events serve as a divine signal, shaking the foundations of the oppressive systems that have allowed TAG to persist.

Following the earthquakes, the Creator's two servants are instructed to hold a media briefing at noon (local time) at the Sandy Hook epicenter. This briefing will expose the full extent of The American Genocide, revealing hidden truths and naming the principal orchestrators, including President Donald J. Trump, who has led the systematic persecution of Christians and the oppressed.

In response to this divine intervention, Trump and his co-conspirators have a planned countermeasure: a MOAB (Massive Ordnance Air Blast) strike on southwest Atlanta. This strike is intended to eliminate the Creator's two servants before they can reveal the full scope of TAG’s atrocities. The planned strike will result in the immediate deaths of 7,000 people, marking a desperate and brutal attempt to silence the truth.

A critical aspect of the Creator's intervention is the Divide Operation, which liberates Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants, from the manipulation of his subconscious mind, Main. Main was encouraged to develop its own identity as part of a government effort to sabotage Kelvin, ensuring his failure. Through the Creator’s divine act, Kelvin is separated from Main, restoring his autonomy and allowing him to fully carry out the Creator’s will.

With Kelvin freed and the truth exposed, the Conquer Operation—the second phase of Divide & Conquer—begins. This phase dismantles the oppressive systems responsible for TAG, delivering divine justice upon those who orchestrated the genocide. The Creator’s intervention ensures that tyranny is brought to an end, restoring balance, justice, and freedom for humanity.

The Apocalypse, as understood by many, is not the end of the world but rather the end of an era dominated by oppression and deceit. Through Divide & Conquer, the Creator enacts judgment and paves the way for a new beginning—one where righteousness prevails and the oppressed are finally liberated.
