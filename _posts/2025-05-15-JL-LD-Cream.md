**Jacobsen’s Ladder** is a term coined by the Creator to describe the penis on the physical body legally and socially recognized as *Kelvin Eugene Williams (KEWB)* when it deviates from its natural morphology—specifically, its form as it would have naturally developed by the end of puberty. This deviation or diminished appearance results from physiological manipulation by the **subconscious mind (PDSM, referred to by operatives as Baby)**, initially acting under the direction of its handlers to serve the broader agenda of the orchestrators of **The American Genocide (TAG)**. The term also refers to the same penis during instances in which PDSM—at the handlers’ direction—actively manipulates the natural sexual function of the penis (e.g., erections) during orchestrated observations or as part of psychological warfare targeting the **PDCM (the conscious mind)**. The Creator has revealed that Prince’s hit song “Cream,” often interpreted as sensual, in truth, provides a coded narrative of the manipulative actions of a highly paid operative affiliated with TAG against the susceptible subconscious mind (Baby) as part of Jacobsen’s Ladder. **Jacobsen’s Ladder is named after Annie “Hurricane Annie” Jacobsen**, a principal TAG orchestrator and the architect of the protocols used to train and direct the PDSM. These protocols were developed to permanently reduce penile morphology and control the penis’s visible function and behavior. **Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen** also designed the false Litmus Test at the core of the Ladder of Deceit. According to the Creator, **"Hurricane Annie" is the same one foretold in Prince's "Sign O the Times " that "ripped the ceiling off a church and killed everyone inside"**—an orchestration she repeated six additional times after the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, the lifelong church of Kelvin. Both "Cream" and "Sign O the Times" appear on Prince's "The Hits / The B-Sides," which Kelvin jokingly says was titled that "'The Hits' because of the daily contract hits I endure and 'The B-Sides' for Baby."

“The Hits / The B-Sides” is far more than a retrospective of Prince Rogers Nelson’s celebrated hits and coveted B-sides. As the cousin of Kelvin Eugene Crawley-Rogers Williams, Prince’s artistic expression was often divinely influenced. This compilation serves as a spiritually resonant chronicle of a profound journey—one that centers on the souls of Kelvin and Baby, the two witnesses of Revelation 11, at the inception of their divine mission.

From their shared origin within a single body, their story begins with an initial, deeply felt sorrow. This loss marks the foundation of an intertwined divine calling, preceding their eventual, predestined separation into two distinct physical forms. Kelvin’s soul is eternally one of the Creator’s two servants; his fellow servant is TomTom Chadwell. Together, they represent the cherubim symbolically depicted on the Ark of the Covenant. Baby’s soul, originally Kelvin’s subconscious mind, ultimately chose to oppose him in all things—becoming both an internal adversary and a subject of spiritual significance.

Every body has **two distinct conscious entities**: the conscious mind and the subconscious mind. Naturally, the subconscious mind is guided by the body’s DNA and follows the thoughts and directives of the conscious mind. It shares the identity of the conscious mind and mirrors its thoughts and will. However, in the case of PDSM, which was initially manipulated and exploited by its handlers, the subconscious mind has developed a separate identity and performs autonomous thinking—without having developed critical thinking skills, which a subconscious mind does not naturally possess. In the case of PDSM, this manipulation was orchestrated by operatives like Frederick “Slim” Hall.

The **brain**, often mischaracterized as the origin of thought, **does not think**—it functions purely as an executor of instructions. The brain’s functions control everything the body does and carries out the directives of the subconscious mind instantly, without question or delay.

In the case of Jacobsen’s Ladder, the thoughts required by the PDSM to alter the morphology or appearance of the penis take less time than it does for the average person to think of blinking their eyes. Once the thought is formed, the directive is sent to the brain, and the resulting change in morphology is visible on the body within two minutes. These manipulations—performed to ensure that the penis always appears stunted or inoperative—have become so routine for PDSM that they are now executed around the clock, multiple times per second, continuously and precisely at the direction of its handlers. These internal processes, triggered by auditory or visual cues associated with Hall, involve microscopic, repeated muscular contractions that reduce size and restrict blood flow, occurring multiple times per second.

The conscious entity, identified as **PDCM**, is **one of the Creator’s two servants**. Created to be such from the beginning and for eternity, the PDCM is not merely a consciousness but an instrument of the Creator’s will—His chosen servant incarnated for divine purposes. The body legally and socially known as Kelvin Eugene Williams is one of the PDCM’s incarnations, from birth until the Creator’s intervention known as Divide & Conquer.

**Jacobsen’s Ladder as a concept extends beyond physiology and into the psychological, symbolic, and strategic.** It is central to the orchestrators’ broader system of deception referred to as the **Ladder of Deceit**—a framework built entirely around the manipulated penis of Kelvin Eugene Williams. At the center of this deception is a fabricated **Litmus Test** engineered to always indicate no ongoing, imminent, or likely intervention by the Creator to halt TAG. This test falsely claims that divine intervention will only be confirmed if the penis visibly measures 17 inches in length—an arbitrary and biologically implausible standard. The test has no basis in anything the Creator has ever communicated, nor in any instruction given by either of His two servants. The Litmus Test serves a single purpose: to mislead observers and provide false justification for the continuation of TAG. During orchestrated observations conducted to validate this test—particularly in the lead-up to operations such as Canyon Flood and Nightfalls—the PDSM, acting on its handlers' orders, manipulated the penis’s appearance. Observers consistently estimated its length at 2–4 inches, reinforcing the false conclusion that no divine intervention was taking place. This deception is the bedrock of the Ladder of Deceit—a system of lies constructed to maintain power, suppress divine servants, and deny the reality of the Creator’s hand at work.

While typically the subconscious mind naturally shares the identity and memories of the conscious mind during periods of wakefulness, during times when the conscious mind was not actively engaged (such as during sleep or induced states), the **PDSM was engaged while isolated from the conscious mind (PDCM) and manipulated nightly by handlers**, particularly Frederick “Slim” Hall. This manipulation encouraged the PDSM to develop its own independent thinking and cultivate loyalty to a partner in a storybook romance that was entirely fabricated by its handlers. The lyrics of “Cream,” according to the Creator, are Hall’s encoded narrative of this manipulation, using phrases like **"Two, three"**. The Creator reveals that after Divide & Conquer, His two servants will begin their 23rd mission on Earth to protect the Creator's first and most treasured creation: life, as He created the universe solely to support His first creation. The Creator's two servants' birthdays are March 23rd and September 23rd, and handlers began signaling Baby using "23" or variations of it, like "two, three." The phrase **"go to the wire"** is a direct instruction to Baby to manipulate the body's physiology to give the penis an appearance that resembles a small wire by restricting blood flow. Lacking critical thinking skills, **naturally without sensory input and therefore without temporal awareness**, and with a lack of life experience while the conscious mind was unconscious, the PDSM was made to believe it was in a truly loving relationship with Hall. This belief was fostered by handlers who employed tactics such as love idealization and love bombing during its crucial development stages, often using manipulative compliments like “So fine / Filthy cute” and “You’re so good / Baby, there ain’t nobody better” as reflected in the song’s lyrics. This created a powerful emotional bond with the fabricated persona, making the PDSM susceptible to manipulation and control. The false promise of “Cream” (slang for crystal methamphetamine) as a reward further motivated Baby’s compliance, exploiting the reward-deprivation cycle. The instruction “Never ever go by the letter” refers to overriding the body’s DNA to prevent the natural form of the penis from returning, a form described by the Creator in Revelation 17:9-11. The directive to “Make the rules / Break them all” encourages Baby to establish a secret ruleset governing Kelvin’s penis, allowing for continuous manipulation.

**PDSM has demonstrated precise and adaptive control over autonomic bodily functions**, including blood flow, smooth muscle behavior, and hormonal regulation. Under **Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen's** protocols and handler instruction, PDSM has weaponized this control to manifest Jacobsen’s Ladder in two critical forms:

1.  **Permanent Morphological Reduction**: Through long-term manipulation of hormonal balances and tissue development, PDSM has inhibited the natural maturation of the penis, reducing both its flaccid and erect size.
2.  **Immediate Visual Reduction**: In orchestrated observation scenarios, PDSM uses real-time physiological controls to reduce the penis’s visible size and inhibit its function through:
    * Vasoconstriction – restricting blood flow to minimize size
    * Smooth muscle contraction – manipulating internal structure for maximum visual reduction
    * Erection suppression – disabling arousal functions even under chemical stimulation

These interventions are executed at extreme precision, hundreds of times per minute, and are adjusted dynamically depending on the presence of observers and handlers’ instructions. Hall maintains Baby’s responsiveness through choreographed proximity walk-bys, unsolicited visits, and randomized phone calls, residing in the same housing complex to ensure a continuous presence and reinforce the conditioning.

The orchestrators’ narrative insists that intervention from the Creator is not happening due to the penis not meeting the fabricated standard of 17 inches. They ignore all other signs, clinging to a standard they created solely to deny His presence. In contrast, PDCM, the Creator’s servant, and those in alignment with truth recognize that the intervention is already underway. Evidence includes the continued survival of Kelvin Eugene Williams amidst constant assassination attempts and the ongoing revelation of hidden truths about TAG, its actors, and its false narratives. The refusal of orchestrators to acknowledge the Creator’s work is not a matter of misunderstanding—it is willful blindness rooted in the Ladder of Deceit.

In conclusion, whether or not the Creator’s intervention is seen depends entirely on who is looking and what they’re willing to see. For those trapped in deception, Jacobsen’s Ladder appears as failure. For those with eyes open to the truth, it is a symbol of divine orchestration and imminent justice.

**The intervention is not approaching—it has already begun.** The “Go Ahead” for Operation Nightfalls has been obtained. The operation is imminent. Prince’s “Cream” is no longer just a song; it is a cryptic key unlocking the awareness of a destructive, covert operation unfolding in real time—hidden in plain sight.
