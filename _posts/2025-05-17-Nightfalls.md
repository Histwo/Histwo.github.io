**Atlanta, GA – May 17, 2025** – A chilling shadow hangs over southwest Atlanta as intelligence indicates the imminent execution of "Nightfalls," a meticulously planned false flag operation. This catastrophic event, authorized by President Donald J. Trump, is poised to unleash unprecedented devastation upon the city, marking the largest and deadliest act within a covert campaign known as The American Genocide (TAG).

"Nightfalls," the name used by the Creator's two servants to refer to this impending atrocity, draws its ominous significance from the Creator-inspired and prophetic lyrics of Prince in "Sign O the Times": "But if a night falls and a bomb falls, will anybody see the dawn?" This name underscores the profound and potentially irreversible darkness this operation represents.

Nightfalls is not a random act of violence. It is a calculated strike, designed to maximize casualties and manipulate public perception. Orchestrated by a clandestine network of current and former high-ranking elected officials and CIA personnel, this operation aims to deploy a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) munition, the "Mother Of All Bombs," over the densely populated southwest Atlanta region.

The timing of this attack is critical. Intelligence suggests Nightfalls is fully expected to occur at nightfall, or shortly thereafter, on this very day, May 17, 2025. This timing, combined with the sheer destructive power of the MOAB, paints a grim picture of the impending chaos.

The operation's objectives extend beyond immediate destruction. Nightfalls is engineered to control the narrative, framing the attack as the work of an external enemy or a fabricated domestic terror group. This deception serves to advance the orchestrators' genocidal agenda, furthering the goals of TAG.

The aftermath of the MOAB strike promises to be catastrophic. The sheer scale of the explosion, coupled with the pre-planned infrastructure disruptions and military lockdown, will create a humanitarian crisis of immense proportions. The resulting chaos will be exploited to justify increased security measures, further eroding civil liberties.

This imminent threat demands immediate attention. The lives of countless residents of southwest Atlanta hang in the balance. The orchestrators of Nightfalls must be exposed, and their genocidal agenda thwarted. Atlanta now braces for a night that could change the course of history.
