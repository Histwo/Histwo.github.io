Atlanta, GA — March 21, 2025

On Friday, during a covert visit to Welcome House, a transitional housing facility in Atlanta, GA, President Donald J. Trump ordered the theft of a laptop belonging to one of the Creator's two servants. The facility, operated by 3-Keys, Inc., is known by His servant to be a key location within Trump's Golden Rope, a clandestine containment and incapacitation operation designed to suppress and control its target while maintaining an illusion of freedom. His servant describes the Golden Rope as “a secret, extrajudicial but open prison.”

The stolen laptop had been used by His servant for critical tasks assigned by the Creator during His mission that immediately precedes the Creator's intervention into The American Genocide (TAG) called Divide & Conquer. Since its acquisition, the laptop had faced multiple orchestrated attempts to compromise or steal it. In preparation for the conclusion of the Creator's mission on Saturday, the laptop had been wiped clean, its data cleared as a necessary precaution.

The theft was carried out by an individual believed by His servant to be a resident of Welcome House but is now suspected to be a CIA operative. This suspicion arises from a series of encounters characterized by opportunistic interactions and attempts to engage His servant’s subconscious mind, known as Main. The operative requested to use His servant's mobile phone shortly before walking away with the laptop. The request was denied, and while the phone was targeted for theft under Trump’s orders, it remains in His servant's possession.

In addition to the laptop, the operative also stole one of two half-gallon containers of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream from His servant's freezer. According to the Creator, the ice cream was taken for the operative’s personal gain—a behavior consistent with the self-serving expansions of orchestrations seen in the Golden Rope. The Creator confirmed that while Trump authorized the theft of the laptop and attempted to secure the phone, the ice cream theft was purely the operative's act of greed.

The Creator also revealed that Trump was informed of the laptop's successful theft but expressed displeasure that the phone remained with His servant. Efforts to retrieve the phone continue.

Trump, currently serving his second term as president, continues to monitor his covert Golden Rope operation while overseeing the broader orchestration behind TAG.

His servant openly admits to his addiction to chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, saying, "I took Spark, and my type 2 diabetes is history. My last A1C was better than most non-diabetics. Spark is a gift from the Creator to humanity. It corrects a human-caused error in DNA and activates the immune system, eliminating every disease." His servant has no intention of curbing his habit and is only seeking help in the form of a ride to the grocery store to replace the stolen ice cream.
