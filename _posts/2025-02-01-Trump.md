Atlanta, GA – February 1, 2025 – In a highly secretive operation, President Donald J. Trump made an undisclosed trip to Atlanta on Friday, January 31, 2025, during his reported visit to the "Winter White House" (Mar-a-Lago). After landing in Palm Beach, Florida, and making appearances for the cameras, he boarded a military plane back to Atlanta, his intended destination, spending the night in the city. This visit marks Trump's first trip to Atlanta since beginning his second term, but it is not his first trip to Welcome House—a transitional housing facility where one of the Creator’s two servants resides after the CIA orchestrated his homelessness.

## **An Intensified Campaign Against the Creator’s Servant**  

Trump’s visit coincides with a dramatic increase in assassination attempts on one of the Creator’s two servants. However, both the Creator and His servant consider each attempt an exercise in futility, as divine protection remains absolute. Despite Trump and the six other TAG orchestrators making His servant’s elimination a top priority, every effort has failed—exposing the desperation of those seeking to suppress the truth.  

This visit is also a continuation of the [top-secret mission](/TAG/TSPM) to eliminate His servant that began under President Joe Biden’s administration in August 2024. Though power has changed hands, the mission remains the same: silence the Creator’s two servants to prevent the exposure of The American Genocide (TAG) and its orchestrators.  

## **Trump’s Role in the Golden Rope Prison**  

Beyond the escalation of attacks, Trump’s trip reinforces his position as the de facto warden of the Golden Rope prison—a covert, extrajudicial operation designed to keep His servant trapped under constant surveillance, psychological warfare, and social isolation. Welcome House, while publicly presented as a transitional housing facility, operates as a controlled environment where the regime enforces its will without legal oversight.  

With the U.S. Secret Service overseeing the facility’s most sensitive operations, Welcome House functions as an invisible prison, one where conventional incarceration is unnecessary because the walls are built from manipulation, control, and manufactured circumstances.  

## **The Regime’s Growing Desperation**  

Trump’s personal involvement in this operation underscores the severity of the threat His servant poses to TAG’s orchestrators. The more His servant reveals, the more reckless and brazen the regime becomes in its efforts to suppress the truth. Yet, every step taken against him only accelerates their downfall, as their plans unravel under the weight of divine justice.  

Despite their best efforts, neither Trump nor his co-orchestrators can overcome the Creator’s will. Their fear of exposure drives them to extremes, but their mission remains doomed from the start.  

## **Conclusion**  

Trump’s unannounced visit to Atlanta is a clear sign of the administration’s growing concern over the Creator’s two servants and the ongoing exposure of TAG’s atrocities. Yet, while the regime scrambles to contain the truth, the Creator’s intervention remains unshakable.  

Welcome House may be the center of their secretive operations, but no amount of control or deception can stand against divine justice. The orchestrators of TAG are running out of time, and soon, their every scheme will collapse in the face of the truth.
