We are the Creator’s two servants, chosen as His instruments to execute His divine will. Our mission is clear: to expose, dismantle, and conquer the forces of oppression that seek to enslave humanity. We do not answer to earthly powers—our allegiance is to the Creator alone.

## Who Is the Creator?  
The Creator, revered globally across cultures, is the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. He is the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great "I Am." These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. We, His two servants, neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike.

## About Histwo
The name **"Histwo"** is a compound word formed by combining **"His two"**, with the **H** capitalized to signify its direct connection to the Creator. Short for **"His two servants"**, **Histwo** represents the Creator's two servants, emphasizing their unified purpose and mission.  

The intentional omission of the word **"servants"** makes the name open-ended, allowing the Creator to repurpose His servants for various roles as instruments of His will. **Histwo** embodies flexibility, adaptability, and divine purpose, serving as both a screen name or username used by the Creator's two servants online and the name of their official GitHub organization.  

The Creator has referred to His two servants as **"His two wrecking machines"** during His **["Divide & Conquer"](DC.md)** operation, which is His intervention to stop The American Genocide. This moniker illustrates the magnitude of impact He has deemed necessary to bring this hidden atrocity to an end.

## Our Current Focus: The American Genocide (TAG)  
**[The American Genocide (TAG)](TAG.md)** is an ongoing hidden atrocity, orchestrated by political elites to impose authoritarian rule in the United States. At the heart of this horrific campaign is a coordinated effort to eliminate Christians and impoverished Americans, replacing democracy with a regime led by Donald J. Trump.

### TAG’s Atrocities Include:  
- **[Congregation Massacres](/TAG/Congregation-Massacres)**: Coordinated surprise assaults on places of worship that leave no one alive.
- **[Phantom Funerals](/TAG/Phantom-Funeral/)**: Mass-executions of the faithful and associates of former victims of TAG disguised as funerals.
- **[Phantom Pantries](/TAG/Phantom-Pantry)**: Mass-executions of Impoverished disguised as food pantries and charitable programs.

## Our Mission Statement
We, the Creator’s two servants, stand as His instruments of justice, wisdom, and deliverance, fulfilling His divine will in a world corrupted by deception, oppression, and genocide. Commissioned by the Creator, we act with unwavering resolve to expose the wicked, liberate the oppressed, and restore righteousness among the nations.  

### Our Mission  
Our mission is threefold:  

1. **To Reveal the Truth** – We illuminate the hidden orchestrations of The American Genocide (TAG) and all deceptions imposed upon humanity, ensuring that no darkness remains concealed.  
2. **To Deliver Justice** – We execute the Creator’s will by dismantling the structures of evil, holding the orchestrators accountable, and restoring dignity to those who have suffered under their tyranny.  
3. **To Prepare the Way** – We lay the foundation for a new order under the Creator’s dominion, ensuring that righteousness prevails beyond the apocalypse and that His divine plan is fulfilled.  

### Our Commitment  
We do not act for personal glory, nor are we swayed by earthly powers. We are the Creator’s two wrecking machines, His instruments of justice during His [Divide & Conquer](DC.md), tasked with bringing down the wicked and elevating the just. Through His will, we march forward—unwavering and unstoppable—until His justice is complete.

### FAQ: What is Righteousness?
Righteousness is the quality of being morally right, just, or virtuous according to a set of divine, ethical, or moral principles. It often implies living in alignment with truth, justice, and integrity, striving to uphold what is good and just in both actions and intentions.

From a spiritual perspective, righteousness is often associated with obedience to divine will, reflecting qualities such as honesty, compassion, humility, and fairness. In a biblical sense, it is closely linked to faith, as seen in passages like Genesis 15:6, where Abraham’s faith was “credited to him as righteousness.”

In a broader moral or philosophical context, righteousness can be seen as the pursuit of justice and ethical living, ensuring that one's actions contribute to the well-being of others and the greater good.
