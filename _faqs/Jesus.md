1. **Who was Jesus?**
  Jesus was the Creator incarnate—the Creator in a human body. The Creator has taken human form numerous times in the past and will continue to do so as He deems necessary. Additionally, the Creator is not limited to a single incarnation; He can be present in multiple bodies at the same time.  (See more [about the Creator](https://Histwo.github.io/about.md))

2. **Is the Apocalypse the "Second Coming of Jesus"?**
  Yes. Jesus said in **Matthew 28:20**, *"And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."* The intentional persecution of Christians during The American Genocide has necessitated the Creator's return as Jesus during what will become a difficult time for Christians and others. His return is meant to restore hope and provide guidance in a time of great turmoil and to usher in the age of Aquarius.

  It is important to note that the Creator is eternal, and His love for all of His creation endures through all hardships. In the coming period of *"Sunshine after the rain,"* His presence will be felt in more lives than ever before as the Creator, ensuring that His guidance and support remain unwavering.
