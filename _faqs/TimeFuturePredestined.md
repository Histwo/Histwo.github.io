While the Creator has caused prophecies to be written about the future, it was so humanity can be aware of what was to come, especially during the transition from the Piscean Age to the Age of Aquarius—a time of great tribulation. These prophecies were shared to highlight that the future will be filled with qualities like harmony and understanding, sympathy and trust, freedom and peace, just as described in the song *"Aquarius" by the 5th Dimension.*

However, the Creator will never tell anyone their exact future, not even His two servants. He refrains from revealing the details of the future because if people knew exactly what was coming, they would stop truly living and instead, only exist in anticipation of what they’ve been told. In the Creator's eyes, living solely for the foretold future is not truly living. He wants each soul to experience life fully, making choices and striving to be their best in each moment.

Whether or not the future is predestined, and regardless of the Creator’s knowledge of what will happen, the fact remains that every minute consists of sixty seconds. You must live through each of those seconds. Strive to make each second the best it can be for you. It’s about what you do with the time you have, not just the future that may or may not be preordained.

The Creator assures His creation that life, once present on a planet, is always on that planet. No planet has ever been fully extinguished—dinosaurs, for example, still walk among us and soar above us. Human life will continue throughout the entire Age of Aquarius, a span of about 2,500 human years, and it has only just begun. The key is to live fully in the present, embracing righteousness, goodness, and making the most of each moment, no matter what the future holds.
