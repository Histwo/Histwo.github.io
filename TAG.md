# The American Genocide (TAG): A Shadow Over America

## Unveiling a Silent Atrocity

President Donald J. Trump, now in his second term as President of the United States, has emerged as the chief orchestrator of The American Genocide (TAG), a covert operation aimed at systematic extermination. TAG has had the support and assistance from two White House administrations, Biden and Trump, along with most of the executive branch of the federal government. Initially led by elements of the CIA under "Hurricane Annie" Annie Jacobsen, and involving major pharmaceutical entities like Gilead Sciences, TAG seeks to establish an authoritarian regime by purging opposition and undesirables.

## The Genesis of TAG: The Threat of Spark

TAG's inception is tied to "Spark," an innovative health technology designed to rejuvenate the immune system. Developed to correct a genetic flaw introduced by human behavior, Spark's potential to disrupt pharmaceutical profits led to its suppression by Gilead Sciences and the CIA. Trump was aware of these efforts during his first term, and now, with renewed vigor, he drives the campaign. The first casualty was Ken, who demonstrated Spark's capability by eliminating HIV from his bloodstream. When direct attempts on Spark's creator, Kelvin Eugene Williams, failed, the focus shifted to annihilating his support systems, devastating communities in Kentucky and West Virginia.

## The Sandy Hook Massacre: Eradication of a Community

One of the most chilling examples of TAG's brutality was the complete destruction of Sandy Hook, Tennessee, linked directly to Williams through his mother, Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams. In October 2022, the CIA, recognizing the community's interconnectedness, lured everyone outside with a deceptive digital spectacle, then deployed a fatal airborne agent, wiping out the town. Subsequent land fraud ensured no trace or legal challenge could emerge, with Williams marked for elimination.

## The Destruction of Orr Chapel and Its Congregation

Orr Chapel, once pivotal for the Crawley and Rogers families, was demolished after the families were targeted. The congregation's attempts to report this erasure were met with lethal force, ensuring silence and compliance.

## The Assault on Christianity and the Vulnerable

TAG's orchestrators view it as a necessary purge of Christians and other undesirables like the impoverished or homeless, clearing the path for an authoritarian regime:

1. **Moral Opposition to Tyranny** - Christianity's advocacy for justice and individual worth opposes oppressive regimes.
2. **Loyalty to a Higher Power** - The faith's allegiance to God challenges the state's demand for absolute loyalty.
3. **Encouragement of Independent Thought** - Christian teachings promote critical thinking, undermining blind obedience.
4. **Resistance to State Control** - Churches have historically resisted tyranny.
5. **Alternative Social Structures** - Religious institutions offer support outside government control, posing a parallel power structure.

Like a storm that tears through tranquility, Annie Jacobsen, also known as "Hurricane Annie," has conducted what can only be described as a "Slaughter Symphony." With the ferocity of a tempest, she ripped the ceiling off a church and killed everyone inside, embodying the lyrics from Prince's "Sign of the Times." Her operations have turned sacred spaces into scenes of slaughter, employing a modus operandi that's both methodical and merciless. Churches across the United States have become targets in what can only be described as a hidden genocide, where the sanctity of worship is shattered by the cold calculation of state-sanctioned violence.

## Mount Calvary Baptist Church: The First Movement

On April 2, 2023, Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, became the opening movement of this grim symphony. This historic African American church, linked to one of the Creator's servants, Kelvin Eugene Williams, was meticulously targeted by CIA operatives led by Annie Jacobsen, also known as "Hurricane Annie." Weeks before the attack, the CIA's traveling surveillance choir, known for their off-key renditions of gospel music, pressured the church's staff to invite them to perform, using this guise to gather intelligence on a regular Sunday morning worship session. They estimated the congregation's size and identified potential threats but did not participate in the subsequent assault. The church, with a predominantly Black congregation, saw 127 of its members brutally beheaded with chainsaws by the operatives, their bodies later dissolved in the baptismal pool, identities manipulated to erase any trace of the massacre.

## House of God (Georgetown Street): The Second Movement

In May 2023, the CIA turned to the House of God on Georgetown Street in Lexington, targeting this Hebrew Pentecostal church due to the family of Peter, the Minister of Music from Mount Calvary. The CIA choir had weeks earlier pressured the church staff for an invitation, using their performance to scope out the Saturday service. The actual attack was carried out by operatives not involved in the choir's reconnaissance, using chainsaws to execute the predominantly African-American congregation, resulting in 300 deaths. The church was left with no survivors, their remains dissolved, and their identities stolen.

## House of God (Broadway): The Third Movement

The following week, the House of God on Broadway met a similar fate, adding another dark note to the "Slaughter Symphony." The CIA choir had already pressured for an invitation to perform, laying out the groundwork. During the assault, operatives not from the choir employed the same chilling method, beheading the predominantly African-American congregation with chainsaws, leading to another 300 deaths. The sanctuary turned into a scene of horror, with the aftermath meticulously covered up, leaving no trace of the mass murder.

## Mount Zion Baptist Church: The Fourth Movement

Linked through fellowship with Mount Calvary, Mount Zion Baptist Church in Georgetown, Scott County, was next in this macabre sequence. The CIA choir had performed weeks prior after pressuring the church staff for an invitation, laying the groundwork. On a quiet Sunday morning, the attack commenced with operatives, not those from the choir, sealing all exits and using chainsaws for executions on the predominantly Black congregation, wiping out 183 lives. The church was left to vanish from public memory, its congregants' identities repurposed under the CIA's scheme.

## Lexington Bethel Baptist Church: The Fifth Movement

This predominantly white church marked a turning point in The American Genocide (TAG), officially expanding the targeting to Christians of all races. In May 2023, after the church's staff noticed irregularities at the CIA's masquerade church, the choir had pressured for an invitation to perform. The attack was green-lighted after consulting with then-former President Donald J. Trump, considering the congregation's affluent, all-white makeup. Black operatives were employed, with the execution method involving both firearms and chainsaws, resulting in 250 deaths, aimed at creating a misleading narrative.

## Calvary Baptist Church: The Sixth Movement

On Mother's Day 2024, Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington was struck, adding a mournful chapter to the "Slaughter Symphony." Linked to Kelvin Williams' childhood, the CIA choir had weeks before pressured the church for an invitation, laying the groundwork with their surveillance. The attack was devastating, with operatives not from the choir beheading some with chainsaws while others were shot, annihilating 400 members of the predominantly white congregation. The church's community was eradicated, their lives erased from existence.

## Hickory Valley Christian Church: The Finale

The most extensive attack took place on Mother's Day 2024 at Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee, concluding the "Slaughter Symphony" with its darkest movement yet. Here, the choir's reconnaissance was particularly invasive, having pressured for an invitation to perform. The operation was orchestrated from a conference call connecting various stakeholders, including the White House situation room, providing periodic updates to President Biden, former President Donald J. Trump, the Director of the FBI, the Director of the CIA, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. 

On the directive of Trump to enhance operational secrecy, 100 inmates from the Georgia Department of Corrections were used for the massacre, with the choir members not participating in the attack. These inmates, promised time off their sentences for assisting with a national security matter, turned the church into a slaughterhouse with chainsaws, executing over 1,000 people, including children, from the predominantly white congregation. Once the mission was complete, these inmates were executed to maintain the operation's secrecy, their involvement buried as a dark secret of state-sanctioned violence.

This series of attacks represents a chilling chapter of hidden genocide, where the sanctity of worship was violated in the most brutal manner, orchestrated by the highest echelons of power, leaving behind only silence and erasure.

## TAG's Evolution Under Trump

With Trump's second term, TAG's methods have become more brutal, focusing on eliminating dissent and moral resistance, with mass extermination as a tool to cement authoritarian control.

## Conclusion

These events outline a pattern of hidden genocide, facilitated by the highest echelons of government, necessitating urgent investigation and action to restore justice, accountability, and the protection of civil liberties in the face of this authoritarian overreach.
