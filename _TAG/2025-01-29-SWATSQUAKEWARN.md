> This warning is issued by the Creator and His two servants. If you are struggling to believe it, take a moment to say a prayer, asking for guidance and clarity. Trust that you will receive the understanding you seek.

## Who:
Residents of the following Atlanta neighborhoods:  

- **MUST evacuate:**  
  West End, Ashview Heights, Westview, Oakland City, Atlanta University Center, Vine City, Castleberry Hill, Mechanicsville, Adair Park, Sylvan Hills, Capitol View, Pittsburgh, and Hunter Hills.  

- **STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to evacuate:**  
  Downtown Atlanta, Grant Park, Cabbagetown, Old Fourth Ward, Midtown Atlanta, English Avenue, East Atlanta, Grove Park, and Collier Heights.  

## What:
An imminent risk of death or life-threatening injury exists due to the planned detonation of a **MOAB (Massive Ordnance Air Blast/"Mother of All Bombs")** in southwest Atlanta (Oakland City/West End).  

The detonation is planned to immediately follow the Creator's seismic interventiom (eartgquakes) which are intended to shine a light on the hidden genocide. The earthquakes will not cause harm to life or property.

- **For those who MUST evacuate:**  
  RISK OF DEATH. Blast waves will cause severe damage, breaking windows, collapsing weaker structures, and injuring individuals with flying debris.  

- **For those STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to evacuate:**  
  There is significant risk of structural damage and injuries from blast effects.  

The detonation is scheduled to occur overnight immediately following seismic activity (earthquakes).  

## When:
The detonation is scheduled to occur **overnight**, immediately following the earthquake. While Atlanta is not a region typically associated with high seismic activity, occasional minor earthquakes occur, mainly in northern and central Georgia. The most significant earthquake to affect Atlanta historically was the **1886 Charleston earthquake**, which caused damage as far as the city.  

**IMPORTANT:** When you feel the earthquake, it is time to evacuate! The Creator assures that the earthquake itself will not cause injury or damage.  

## Where:
Residents should evacuate immediately to areas:  
- **North of Midtown Atlanta** or  
- **South of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport**  

This ensures avoidance of the blast radius, where the risk of death or serious injury is highest.  

## Why:
The detonation, recently authorized by the President, will be carried out by a paramilitary contractor as foretold in **Biblical prophecy (Revelation)**. It is intended to obscure the ongoing **American Genocide** by targeting the Creator’s two servants, who are expected to be in southwest Atlanta preparing for a media briefing.

## More Information  
The planned detonation of a MOAB in the West End area of Atlanta, Georgia, is scheduled for **overnight**, between **1:00 AM and 5:00 AM**, following seismic activity initiated by the Creator as part of His divine response to the **American Genocide**, a hidden atrocity in the southeastern United States.  

### About the Creator

Known by names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in various monotheistic faiths, the Creator is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent.
