Atlanta, GA – February 9, 2025 – President Donald J. Trump has made another undisclosed visit to Welcome House in downtown Atlanta, arriving on the evening of Saturday, February 8. According to revelations from the Creator to one of His two servants, as well as direct observations by His servant residing at Welcome House, Trump’s presence is tied to an orchestrated effort to eliminate one of the Creator’s two servants. The operation also seeks to obtain electronic devices, secret decryption keys, and any other materials connected to a divine task currently in progress.

As of 10:00 AM on Sunday, February 9, Trump remains in Atlanta. His continued presence raises concerns about the scale and urgency of the operation, which aligns with previous covert actions linked to The American Genocide (TAG). Welcome House has increasingly become a battleground for these orchestrations, underscoring its significance in the ongoing conflict between divine intervention and the forces seeking to suppress it.
