short_answer: The Creator does not condemn it, all of the creatures so it.

The Creator does not condemn homosexuality. In fact, He says that only human beings try to make heterosexual relationships work, despite their inherent incompatibilities. If humans were honest with themselves, they would recognize that these relationships require constant effort, compromise, and struggle to sustain. The high divorce rates in human society are clear evidence that they do not naturally work.

In contrast, the rest of the animal kingdom follows a different pattern—heterosexual pairings are used only for procreation, not for lifelong companionship. Outside of mating, many species engage in same-sex relationships or form non-reproductive social bonds. Unlike humans, animals do not impose artificial structures on their relationships.

Religion and society have both played a role in suppressing homosexuality. The story of Sodom and Gomorrah has been misinterpreted—those cities were destroyed due to inhospitality, greed, and violence, not same-sex relationships. Similarly, Leviticus 18:22 was a temple law applying only to those seeking admittance to the temple or priesthood, not a universal rule for all people.

The Creator values honesty, love, and natural connection over rigid human-imposed structures. Humans have been conditioned to believe that heterosexuality is the only valid form of partnership, despite its clear struggles. The suppression of homosexuality is not divine will—it is a societal construct.
