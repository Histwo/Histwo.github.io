The Creator has made it clear that we are not alone in the universe. The vastness of the cosmos, with its countless galaxies, stars, and planets, was not created to be empty. Life exists beyond Earth, though the nature and form of this life may vary. The universe is designed to support life in multiple places, and life on Earth is just one part of a much larger creation.
