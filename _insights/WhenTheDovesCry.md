title: "When the Doves Cry: The True Meaning Behind Prince’s Song"
---

Prince’s *When Doves Cry* is often seen as a song about lost love and emotional turmoil, but its true meaning is far more profound. It is a prophetic lament—a divine message foretelling a massacre so brutal that only the Creator Himself heard the cries of the innocent.  
On **April 2, 2023**, during Sunday worship at **Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky**, a massacre unfolded. Under the command of CIA operative **Annie Jacobsen**, known as **“Hurricane Annie”**, armed forces stormed the sanctuary. **Exits were blocked, windows covered, and anyone attempting to flee was gunned down.** Congregants who called **911** unknowingly spoke to **fake dispatchers**, who assured them that help was on the way—help that never came.  

The attack escalated into brutal **assault, rape, and systematic execution**. Victims were **beheaded with chainsaws at the piano and organ**, forced to witness their loved ones' slaughter before facing the same fate.  

**The Creator, the very one they had gathered to worship, was now having to hear their cries—the cries of doves.**  

Prince, a cousin of one of the Creator’s two servants and deeply connected to divine inspiration, unknowingly transcribed this tragedy into *When Doves Cry* decades before it happened. His lyrics, far from a simple relationship song, **encode the horror of that day**.

## **The Lyrics as a Window Into the Massacre**  

### **A Picture of Terror and the Desperate Search for Escape**  
> *"Dig if you will the picture, If you are not engaged in a kiss"*  
> *"The sweat of your body covers me, Can you my darling, Can you picture this?"*  

These words describe **a desperate attempt to flee, not in body, but in mind.** As terror spread, at least one congregant—possibly a mother—**tried to guide others, likely children, to imagine another place, a peaceful and beautiful place, rather than the horror of their church’s sanctuary.**  

> *"Dream, if you can, a courtyard, An ocean of violets in bloom"*  

She urged them to picture **a serene courtyard, a field of violets, a place untouched by violence**—anything to momentarily escape the terror of that morning.  

### **The Operatives: Beasts Masquerading as Men**  
> *"Animals strike curious poses, They feel the heat, The heat between me and you"*  

The “animals” were not innocent creatures. **They were the operatives who had stormed the church, acting like beasts—soulless, merciless.** Their weapons drawn, their faces cold, they moved with an unnatural control, **their “curious poses” reflecting the cruelty of their mission.**  

They could feel the “heat” between themselves and the congregants—the raw, desperate fear of those who knew they would not survive.  

### **The Agonizing Question: Why Were They Forsaken?**  
> *"How can you just leave me standing, Alone in a world that's so cold?"*  
> *"Maybe I'm just too demanding, Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold"*  
> *"Maybe you're just like my mother, She's never satisfied"*  

These lyrics capture the **anguish and disbelief of those crying out to the Creator**. They had gathered in faith, trusting that divine protection would shield them—**only to face brutal slaughter**. Their desperate prayers went unanswered, and as the executioners closed in, they **doubted themselves, their faith, and their worthiness**.  

The line **“How can you just leave me standing, alone in a world that’s so cold?”** echoes their last thoughts—**why were they left to suffer?**  

### **The Execution of Children**  
> *"Don't make me chase you"*  

These words were **not a plea from a lover** but a command—**the chilling command yelled by operatives as children ran in fear, trying to escape their execution.**  

Some children, too young to comprehend what was happening, still had the instinct to run. **But there was nowhere to go.**  

The operatives, already desensitized to violence, **shouted these words as they grabbed the children and forced them forward to meet their executioner.**  

### **The Final Moments: The Sound of Innocence Dying**  
> *"Why do we scream at each other? This is what it sounds like when doves cry."*  

As the chainsaws roared and the final screams filled the church, **this was the sound of doves crying**. The doves—symbolizing purity, peace, and the Holy Spirit—were slaughtered that day. The Creator had to hear them cry out for hours, restrained by His **non-interventionist stance**.

## **The Creator’s Non-Interventionist Stance**  

The Creator’s **non-interventionist stance** ensures that free will and natural law govern existence without constant divine interference. He acts as an **architect, not a micromanager**, allowing humanity to make choices and face their consequences. **Intervention is rare and strategic**, occurring only to fulfill His greater purpose, not to manipulate everyday events.  

Suffering, injustice, and death are **part of the human experience**, meant to foster wisdom and growth rather than be prevented by divine force. While the Creator’s servants carry out His missions, their success depends on human choices. He allows events to unfold according to natural law and human decisions, ensuring that moral responsibility remains with humanity.

Prince’s lyrics, though written long before, bear **a haunting accuracy** to the events of that day. The song was not simply a creative masterpiece—it was **divinely inspired**, carrying the hidden history of a tragedy few would ever know.  

The world was left unaware, the crime erased from official records. But the Creator remembers. And *When Doves Cry* stands as an unspoken memorial to those who perished that day, their voices forever echoing in the music, waiting for the truth to be recognized.
