Prince’s iconic song *When Doves Cry* has long been recognized for its raw emotional intensity, enigmatic lyrics, and haunting melody. However, the true inspiration behind this song reaches far beyond personal relationships—it was, in fact, inspired by the Creator, who placed the song in Prince’s spirit to convey an unspoken tragedy. The song immerses listeners into one of the darkest moments of The American Genocide, specifically the massacre of the congregation at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, led by CIA Senior Operative Annie Jacobsen—also known as "Hurricane Annie."

## **The Meaning of “When Doves Cry”**

The term “doves” in the song symbolizes peace. The Creator has stated that people attending worship services are some of the most peaceful individuals on the planet in those moments. They gather not to wage war or plot destruction but to seek solace, strength, and connection with the divine. When a government-backed paramilitary force invades such a sacred space and executes every person in attendance, the sound of crying doves—the ultimate desecration of peace—becomes unbearable.

The massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church was one of seven systematic mass executions led by Hurricane Annie and her operatives, referred to in the song as "animals." During the attack, armed men stormed the sanctuary, blocked every exit, and executed each congregant at the front of the church by beheading them with chainsaws near the piano and organ. In the midst of the chaos, the song’s protagonist—a worshipper—attempts to shield others, likely children, from the horrors unfolding before them.

## **Decoding the Lyrics**

Some of the song’s most cryptic lines take on a chilling new meaning in this context:

- **“Dig if you will the picture”** – The protagonist urges the children to imagine something—anything—other than the slaughter before them, guiding their minds away from the horror they witness.
- **“If you are not engaged in a kiss”** – A plea to either embrace a loved one for comfort or say a final goodbye before they are dragged away to be executed.
- **“Don’t make me chase you”** – A chilling phrase uttered by the operatives as terrified children ran around the sanctuary, trying desperately to evade capture and execution.

The song’s refrain is not a lament of lost love but rather the desperate prayers of worshippers. The Creator heard these prayers—urgent calls to 911 that never resulted in help. The victims believed assistance was on the way, only to be deceived. Their calls were intercepted by a secondary CIA team posing as 911 operators, who assured them that help was coming while ensuring that none would arrive. Their betrayal was complete.

## **Hurricane Annie's First Appearance: A Prophetic Foretelling**

Before the massacre at Mount Calvary, Hurricane Annie was introduced in Prince’s earlier song *Sign of the Times*. In this song, she is foretold with chilling precision in the lyrics:

> “Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling off a church and killed everyone inside.”

This line serves as an eerie premonition, foreshadowing the horrors to come during The American Genocide, where Hurricane Annie, leading the CIA-backed forces, would carry out the brutal massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church. Prince, as a channel for the Creator’s message, set the stage for the public to bear witness to the unfolding tragedy long before it would occur.

## **The Creator’s Non-Intervention Policy**

The massacre at Mount Calvary, like the others, was a moment of agonizing sorrow for the Creator. His non-intervention policy, however, stems from a fundamental principle: free will and natural consequences are essential for growth and development. Conscious beings must face their own choices and their own struggles. The Creator has spoken on this, stating:

> “Conscious entities that begin an activity with a desired goal will persist and increase their efforts until that goal is achieved, unless hindered by external obstacles or forces.”

By allowing events to unfold without divine interference, the Creator ensures that humanity bears witness to the full scope of its actions—both righteous and wicked. This does not mean that the Creator condones such atrocities. On the contrary, the weeping of doves—the slaughter of peaceful worshippers—remains an affront so grievous that its consequences will reverberate beyond the perpetrators’ understanding.

## **A Cry for Justice**

*When Doves Cry* is more than just a song—it is a memorial for the innocent lives lost, a chilling reminder that the massacre in Mount Calvary Baptist Church was not an isolated incident. The song places the listener inside the sanctuary during the horrific events, immersing them in the terror and anguish of those who were executed in cold blood. The public remains unaware that this massacre was one of seven orchestrated in the same brutal fashion, each one a symbol of the cruelty perpetrated against peaceful worshippers.

But the song also serves another, more profound purpose—it allows us to feel what the Creator had to endure as the executions took place. For hours, the Creator bore witness to the agony of His people, helpless in the face of such overwhelming violence. This act of divine endurance—the silent suffering as the Creator’s children were slaughtered—reveals a side of His purpose and will that many fail to grasp.

*When Doves Cry* is not only a testament to the victims but also a key to understanding why the Creator, in His wisdom, has deemed it necessary to intervene. Though the Creator normally does not interfere with the natural course of events, this atrocity was too great, too devastating for Him to ignore. The song beckons the world to comprehend the depth of this tragedy and why it has led to the Creator’s decision to act. Justice, though delayed, is certain, and His intervention—though born of immense sorrow—will bring an end to the suffering and betrayal that allowed these events to unfold. The crying doves will be heard, and their cry will not be in vain.
