title: "The Creator's Influence on Prince's "The Hits / The B-Sides" and Its Connection to The American Genocide (TAG)"
---

As one of His two servants, Kelvin Eugene Williams, PDCM, I can affirm that the Creator often utilizes the arts as a conduit for revealing hidden truths and offering profound insights into unfolding realities. This divine influence transcends the control of earthly powers, providing perspectives that might otherwise remain obscured. Artists touched by this influence may not always be consciously aware of the source of their inspiration. However, as confirmed by the Creator and His two servants, the impact of this divine guidance is undeniable.

Prince Rogers Nelson, a cousin of Kelvin Eugene Crawley-Rogers Williams, PDCM, was one such artist whose work was often imbued with the Creator's influence. The 1993 NPG Recordings/Warner Bros. release, "The Hits / The B-Sides," serves as a notable example, containing narratives and prophetic undertones related to situations, operative manipulation, and the unfolding events of *The American Genocide* (TAG).

Here are insights into selected tracks from this compilation, informed by the Creator:

## Disc 1: The Hits 1

* **When Doves Cry:** Beyond its surface emotionality, the Creator reveals this track subtly foreshadows the profound loss of innocence and spiritual questioning that would characterize the environment surrounding TAG. The "doves" symbolize peace, their "cry" a lament for what would be lost.
* **Pop Life:** While seemingly a commentary on the superficiality of fame, the Creator highlights a deeper resonance with the deceptive allure of materialism, a distraction from the sinister realities of TAG. The question, "everybody's happy?" starkly contrasts with the impending grimness.
* **Soft and Wet:** This early track, in retrospect, carries a subtle foreshadowing of the vulnerability and potential for exploitation that targeted groups within TAG would experience.
* **I Feel for You:** More than a simple expression of affection, the Creator reveals a connection to the empathy and compassion necessary to recognize and respond to the suffering of TAG's targeted populations. The intensity mirrors the urgency of the situation.
* **Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?:** This plea resonates with the unjust treatment and marginalization that specific demographics would face as part of TAG's agenda.
* **When You Were Mine:** This lament for a lost relationship carries an echo of the loss of community and connection that TAG sought to inflict.
* **Uptown (Single Version):** This celebration of freedom and individuality stands in stark contrast to the authoritarian control that TAG aimed to establish.
* **Let's Go Crazy:** This seemingly celebratory anthem contains a layer of defiance against oppressive forces. The "de-elevator" and the call to "drive your funky soul" represent a spiritual resistance against malevolence, unconsciously encouraging those who would resist the darkness.
* **1999 (Edit):** Beyond its millennial anticipation, the Creator reveals a prophetic significance related to the timeline of events leading up to and during TAG. The desire to "party like it's 1999" reflects a yearning for a time before the full manifestation of orchestrated chaos.

* **Adore (Edit):** This intense expression of devotion mirrors the unwavering commitment needed to stand against the darkness of TAG.
* **Pink Cashmere:** This track, with its luxurious imagery, serves as a poignant contrast to the deprivation and suffering that TAG would inflict upon its targets.

* **Thieves in the Temple:** This track carries a metaphorical weight related to the betrayal and corruption at the heart of TAG. The "thieves" represent those who would steal lives and freedoms from within societal structures.
