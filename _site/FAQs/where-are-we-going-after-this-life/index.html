    <h2>Full Answer</h2>
    <p>The Creator says that a conscious entity (many call this a soul) once created will never be eliminated and cannot die. When a body dies, the consciousness is released and reincarnated into the next body that needs a consciousness, which can occur anywhere in the universe. Conscious entities carry forward the characteristics and attributes they develop in each lifetime, but memories from previous lifetimes are not retained. This is done to prevent the immense sadness or emotional distress that could arise from remembering those they loved and lost in prior lives (imagine being born and remembering everyone you loved and knew, but they aren’t with you).</p>

<p>While the personality traits—such as passive vs. aggressive, submissive vs. dominant, or dynamic vs. reserved—are carried over, they are shaped and refined through each new life. The decision to improve one’s characteristics in each lifetime is a personal one. Additionally, concepts like “soulmates,” “twin flames,” and “old souls” are real phenomena, reflecting the deep and lasting connections formed across lifetimes. These relationships and experiences contribute to the ongoing evolution of a conscious entity, growing and learning over time.</p>
