    <p><strong>Who was Jesus?</strong>
Jesus was the Creator incarnate—the Creator in a human body. The Creator has taken human form numerous times in the past and will continue to do so as He deems necessary.

    <p><strong>Is the Apocalypse the “Second Coming of Jesus”?</strong>
Yes. Jesus said in <strong>Matthew 28:20</strong>, <em>“And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”</em> The intentional persecution of Christians during The American Genocide has necessitated the Creator’s return as Jesus during what will become a difficult time for Christians and others. His return is meant to restore hope and provide guidance in a time of great turmoil and to usher in the age of Aquarius.</p>

    <p>It is important to note that the Creator is eternal, and His love for all of His creation endures through all hardships. In the coming period of <em>“Sunshine after the rain,”</em> His presence will be felt in more lives than ever before as the Creator, ensuring that His guidance and support remain unwavering.</p>
